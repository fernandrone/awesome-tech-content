# Awesome Tech Content

This is my personally curated list of books, blog posts, essays, papers, articles,
keynotes, talks and any kind of tech-related content that I find awesome.

If you have found something awesome on the internet and want to share with me, sure, I
like learning about stuff! I can easily be reached by the email on my GitHub profile or
on Twitter. But unlike most `awesome-stuff` repositories this is a personal list so I'll
not really be taking recommendations 😬

## Software Engineering

- [Queues Don't Fix Overload](https://ferd.ca/queues-don-t-fix-overload.html) ·
  _Fred Hebert_ · Article

    A convincing article on why queues are not the end-all solution to rate limiting
    your slow web application. If you do apply it as a staple overload reliability
    mechanism, you _will_ get much more complex systems that _once they fail_ will fail
    much harder, so think carefully. It also introduced me to the concepts of
    back-pressure and load-shedding: _"You'll need to pick what has
    to give whenever stuff goes bad. You'll have to pick between blocking on input
    (back-pressure), or dropping data on the floor (load-shedding). And that happens all
    the time in the real world, we just don't want to do it as developers, as if it were
    an admission of failure._"

- [Configuration Is (riskier than?) Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcT8-IoImXE) ·
  _Jamie Wilkinson_ · Video

    Great presentation! It asks if there are really any fundamental differences between
    _code_ and _configuration_ (there isn't) and presents evidence that changing what we
    perceive to be configuration is riskier than code. Ironically, there's much better
    tooling and rigour involved when working with code, as often configuration won't
    have tests, static checkers or even any form of version control. I believe
    [Accelerate](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/accelerate/9781457191435/)
    corroborates this: _"keeping system and application configuration in version control
    was more highly correlated with software delivery performance than keeping
    application code in version control. Configuration is normally considered a
    secondary concern [...] but our research shows that this is a misconception."_

- [Are We Really
  Engineers?](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/crossover-project/are-we-really-engineers/)
  · _Hillel Wayne_ · Essay

    Part 1 of Hillel's "Crossover Project". A thoughtful look into the old-age question
    of "is Software Engineering _really_ Engineering" (which is unfortunately often
    expressed in bad faith with the intention to to gatekeep). Followed by Part 2 ["We
    Are Not
    Special"](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/crossover-project/we-are-not-special/)
    and Part 3 ["What Engineering Can Teach (and Learn from)
    Us"](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/crossover-project/what-we-can-learn/).

- [Serverless Computing: One Step Forward, Two Steps
  Back](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.03651.pdf) · _Hellerstein et al_ · Paper

    I've read it a long time ago and, being from 2018, some things might be outdated.
    Some of the things I remember is while AWS Lambda has its strenghts (pay-as-you-go,
    autoscale), a full serverless architecture presents several I/O performance
    constraints compare to a more traditional EC2 architecure. Cindy Sridharan has some
    good highlights on [her
    Twitter](https://twitter.com/copyconstruct/status/1075086886610169857?s=20). Highly
    recommend viewing Table 1 (but, again, I can't guarantee it hasn't been somewhat
    deprecated given the timeframe).

- Understanding Clojure's Persistent Vectors ([pt.
  1](https://hypirion.com/musings/understanding-persistent-vector-pt-1) / [pt.
  2](https://hypirion.com/musings/understanding-persistent-vector-pt-2))  · _Jean Niklas
  L'orange_ · Article

    Interesting articles on Clojure's Persistent Vectors, a data structure invented by
    Rich Hickey _which gives practically O(1) runtime for appends, updates, lookups and
    subvec_. When I first heard about it I thought it sounded weird; what's up with the
    constant speed (hint: the word _pratically_ is doing a lot of heavy lifting here)?
    And why the heck so-called [Lazy Sequences](https://clojure.org/reference/sequences)
    always return a [chunk of exactly 32
    values](http://blog.fogus.me/2010/01/22/de-chunkifying-sequences-in-clojure/) when
    realizing its value? Well, these misteries are explained in the articles linked
    above. Also, if you are that kind of person, you can read the paper that inspired
    Persistent Vectors: [Ideal Hash
    Trees](http://lampwww.epfl.ch/papers/idealhashtrees.pdf) · _Phil Bagwell_

- [Command-line Tools can be 235x Faster than your Hadoop
  Cluster](https://adamdrake.com/command-line-tools-can-be-235x-faster-than-your-hadoop-cluster.html)
  · _Adam Drake_ · Article

  Well, exactly what the title says! Fun examples of how an intelligent use of basic
  unix commands such as `cat` or `awk` in a modern laptop can yield better results than
  a much more powerful Hadoop cluster for certain tasks, such as text processing. I
  mean, check out this quote: _for the same amount of data I was able to use my laptop
  to get the results in about 12 seconds (processing speed of about 270MB/sec), while
  the Hadoop processing took about 26 minutes (processing speed of about 1.14MB/sec)._

- [Mailinator Architecture](http://highscalability.com/mailinator-architecture) · _Todd
  Hoff_ · Article

  A short article on [mailinator.com](https://www.mailinator.com/) architecture.
  Warning, it is from 2008 so highly dated. Yet, it is an interesting story about how a
  Java App running on a box that's worse than a current-gen t2.micro was still
  processing 75 reqps, handling DDOS and supposedly had 99.99% availability. Surely the
  application is relatively simple and most modern business have very different
  constraints - if nothing else, the right HA architecture can make mantaining your
  service as a team much easier. At the same time, while it is very hard to compare
  workloads, I'm used seeing microsservices being provisioned with 10 times as much
  resources to serve a tiny fraction of the load, so I feel there's still something to
  learn from this piece.

## Resilience Engineering

- [The Problem with the 5 Whys](https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/26/8/671) · _Alan
  J Card_ · Paper

    Best critique of the "5 Whys" technique that I have ever read. Essentially, it
    _"insists on a single root cause as the target for solutions and assumes that the
    most distal link on the causal pathway [...] is inherently the most effective and
    efficient place to intervene"_. If nothing else, you ought to check out this
    outstanding representation of the "causal and contributing factors tree diagram"
    that different teams might arrive by each applying the "5 Whys" technique
    independently at the same incident.

- [The Infinite Hows](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-infinite-hows/) · _John Allspaw_
  · Article

    If you have enjoyed the previous paper about the 5 Whys and want more, this is a
    good read. John explains why the 5 Whys also isn't that much of a good idea for
    Software Engineers working with complex distributed systems, gives you an
    alternative technique and drops a lot of links so you can spend a whole afternoon
    reading about the topic.

## Math

- [What happens when you add a new teller?
](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2008/10/21/what-happens-when-you-add-a-new-teller/) · _John D. Cook_
  · Article

  This article explores a typical example from queuing theory (disclaimer, I didn't
  really study queuing theory besides reading a few articles such as this one). The
  whole idea is that, given the problem's constraints, the difference between having a
  single teller in a bank would make customers wait nearly five hours on average. Add a
  second teller and the average wait time **goes down to just 3 minutes**! What? There's
  some funny math involved but the results can be extrapolated to workers consuming from
  a queue, and it's something that can happen if the queue is close to saturation (i.e.
  the processing rate is very close to the consumption rate). I think the conclusions
  here are a) avoid leaving your queues close to saturation and b) if they **are** close
  to saturation doubling your workers might give you a much larger performance boost
  than expected.

## Negotiation

- [Salary Negotiation: Make More Money, Be More
  Valued](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/) · _Patrick McKenzie_
  · Essay

    Very good article on Salary Negotiation for Software Engineers. If you read _one_
    piece on the topic, make it this one!

- [Sonia Gupta and Corey Quinn - Embarrassingly Large Numbers: Salary Negotiation for
  Humans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jK6yrvsSaFs) · _Corey Quinn & Sonia Gupta_ ·
  Video

    Fun video on the topic.

## Hiring

- [My Lessons from Interviewing 400+ Engineers Over Three
  Startups](https://review.firstround.com/my-lessons-from-interviewing-400-engineers-over-three-startups)
  · _Marco Rogers_ · Article

    My favorite article about hiring software engineers. There's a lot to take from it,
    but my favorite is that, as a hiring manager at a fast growing company, you probably
    need to be interviewing a lot more. Hiring is a noisy process and the steps at the
    beginning of the funnel have very low confidence (and, in my opinion, are easier to
    gatekeep); so if you want to build a strong team you need to create a system that
    allows the team to interview multiple candidates for each hire. Instead, I have met
    hiring managers at startups that were more worried about creating barriers to filter
    out candidates.

- [Tell candidates what to expect from your job
  interviews](https://jvns.ca/blog/2020/06/30/tell-candidates-what-to-expect-from-your-job-interviews/)
  · _Julia Evans_ · Article

    Well, what's on the title! It helps to "level the playing field", so to speak. I
    mean, Stanford has a [course that prepares students for the standard Software
    Interview](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs9/), and students from top-level
    Universities in other countries will gain similar advantages through networking. I'm
    confident that a lot of candidates for any given company are either hired _because
    of_ a referral _or_ will have a friend inside give them some tips about the hiring
    process. All this means that candidates without a strong networking and/or a
    non-traditional background and/or URMs (a lot of overlap here) will be at a
    disvantadge. The solution? Level the playing field by telling everyone what to
    expect of your process in advance.

## Venture Capital

- [The Holloway Guide to Equity
  Compensation](https://www.holloway.com/g/equity-compensation)

  A very, very, very long but very compreehensive resource on Equity. Of course some of
  the information, specially tax-related, is geographically bounded to the US, but I
  think it is still a very useful read if you might earn or negotiate any form
  of Equity anywhere in the world.

## Historical

The references here are mostly kept for their historical significance but likely don't
have much application on modern technology.

- [Debunking the 'Expensive Procedure Call' Myth, or, Procedure Call Implementations
  Considered Harmful, or, Lambda: The Ultimate
  GOTO](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/5753/AIM-443.pdf) · _Steele, Guy
  Lewis, Jr._ · Paper

    Keeping this in my pocket mostly in case I ever hear someone arguing that an extra
    function call would impact performance and I need something to smack the doofus back
    to the 70's with.

- [Structured Programming with go to
  Statements](http://www.kohala.com/start/papers.others/knuth.dec74.html) · _Donald E.
  Knuth_ · Paper

    The paper that popularized _"pre mature optimization is the root of all evil"_,
    although there's an earlier source from
    [November](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/361604.361612). The paper is a
    discussion about `Structured Programming` and the pros and cons of `go to`
    statements so it is very dated. I list it here because of one interesting curiosity:
    although oft-quoted as a warning against any kind of optimization effort, Knuth's
    words are very specifically a comment on sacrifing legibility to optimize
    **non-critical** parts of the program. In fact, he writes it just after using
    _multiple_ `go-to` statement to increase the performance of a program by 12% and
    complaining about how most software engineers wouldn't consider such improvement
    worthy of their attention. He still concludes that _"premature emphasis on
    efficiency is a big mistake which may well be the source of most programming
    complexity and grief"_ and that _"we should strive most of all for a program that is
    easy to understand and almost sure to work"_ but I nevertheless think the original
    context gives the quote a new meaning.
